# drone-robust-gender-classification
For autonomous rescue drones, it is important to recognize rescue requesters. Since there are lots of noise sources in a disaster area including the drone itself, such a system also requires denoising and voice activity detection. This code provides a male-woman-child recognition system for rescue drones which is written in Python, based on Pytorch
